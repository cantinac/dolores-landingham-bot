This is a Slack bot that helps onboard new hires at Cantina through scheduled Slack
messages about topics relevant to our employees. Mrs. Landingham will walk you through how we work, 
where you can find information, and other general information that is important to new hires.

Please file an issue if you have any questions about Mrs. Landingham.

Mrs. Landingham is a forked bot, created by the fine folks at [18F](https://github.com/18F/dolores-landingham-bot)
